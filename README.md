## Project Overview

Based on the organization's wishes, our team was tasked with (1) creating the website, ensuring it's responsive and (2) incorporating the back-end side from scratch. They wanted to expand their network and resources by adding a forms tab that asks students or donors to provide their information when interested. Previously, they only did these by messaging people through email and social media. They wanted to track them all in a more efficient and easy-to-access system. Hence, we built a straightforward monitoring system on a hidden HTML file that fetches data from Google Firebase.
